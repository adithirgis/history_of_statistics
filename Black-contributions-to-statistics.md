# Contributions of Black scientists & researchers to Statistics

This page was created for [#ShutDownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/) on June 10, 2020. 

The structure of the page is as follows: each heading represents a Black statistician, mathematician, scientist, or other researcher who has made important contributions to the field of statistics. Contributions are listed under the heading. There is no particular ordering to the headings. 

This is not meant to be a complete list or static source. It should grow and change. Please contribute by making a pull request or filing an issue. 

#### General Resources

- Wikipedia
- [Mathematicians of the African Diaspora](http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/00.INDEXmad.html)

## [David Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blackwell)

#### Fields: game theory, probability theory, information theory, and Bayesian statistics

- [The Rao-Blackwell theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem): The Raoâ€“Blackwell theorem states that if g(X) is any kind of estimator of a parameter, then the conditional expectation of g(X) given T(X), where T is a sufficient statistic, is typically a better estimator of the parameter, and is never worse. 

Books:  
- Theory of Games and Statistical Decisions (1954; with M.A. Girshick)
- Basic Statistics (1969): one of the earliest textbooks on Bayesian statistics 

The [Blackwell-Tapia](https://mathinstitutes.org/diversity/blackwell-tapia-conference/) prize recognizes a mathematician who has served as a role model for mathematical scientists and students from underrepresented minority groups or has contributed in other significant ways to addressing the problem of underrepresentation of minorities in mathematics.


## [Albert Turner Bharucha-Reid](http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/bharucha-reid_a_t.html)

#### Fields: algebra, analysis, mathematical biology, statistics, and topology

Books:  
- Elements of the Theory of Markov Processes and Their Application (1960)
- Probabilistic Methods in Applied Mathematics (1968)
- Random Polynomials, Probability and Mathematical Statistics (1986)

## [Charles B. Bell, Jr.](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/bell-jr-charles-b-1928/)

#### Fields: nonparametric statistics, stochastic processes and related application areas

Authored [many papers](http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/bell_charlesb.html) on distrbution-free (nonparametric) statistics, on the topics of: 
- structure of distribution-free statistics,
- characterization of multi-sample distribution-free statistics,
- optimal one-sample distribution-free tests,
- distribution-free tests of independence, and 
- distribution-free tests of randomness.

Also collaborated with David Blackwell. 

## [W.E.B. DuBois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois)

#### Fields: sociology, history 

Created [The American Negro](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/w-e-b-du-bois-hand-drawn-infographics-of-african-american-life-1900), an exhibit at the World Fair in 1900 in Paris which included dozens of **data visualizations** about the lives of Black people in the United States at the turn of the century, 35 years after the end of slavery.
