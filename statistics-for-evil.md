# Statistics for Evil

One of the reasons to learn about the history of statistics is to know when, how, and why statistics has been used for evil. If we don't know this history, and if we don't guard against it, we are doomed to repeat it. While you're here, remind yourself of the American Statistical Association's [Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EthicalGuidelines.pdf). 

This page is going to be uncomfortable to read. That is the point. The following examples describe instances where people have used and manipulated statistics to further an agenda that caused harm. (Note that the intent does not matter. The effects are what matters, though often the intent and the effects are both evil.)

## Statistics in support of racist and white supremacist agendas

### Statistics in support of anti-Black agendas 

#### The work of Frederick Ludwig Hoffman

Hoffman was an American statistician and the 7th president of the American Statistical Association. He authored [Race traits and tendencies of the American Negro](https://archive.org/details/racetraitstenden00hoff/page/n6/mode/2up) (1896), in which he argued, essentially that African Americans and Indigenous peoples of the Americas were destined to become extinct because they biologically cannot live in white "civilization." The report was commissioned by the insurance company where he worked to prove that African Americans were "uninsurable." (Leglislation had recently been passed banning descrimination against African Americans.)

By [Ibram X. Kendi](https://amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/612457/): "'Nothing is more clearly shown from this investigation than that the southern black man at the time of emancipation was healthy in body and cheerful in mind,' Frederick Hoffman wrote in *Race Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro.* 'What are the conditions thirty years after?' Hoffman concluded from 'the plain language of the facts' that black Americans were better off enslaved. They are now 'on the downward grade,' he wrote, headed toward 'gradual extinction.'" (Nevermind that Hoffman never knew an America with slavery: he was born in Germany in 1865 and moved to the US in 1891.)
