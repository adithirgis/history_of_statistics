# About this project

This is the brainchild of Sam Tyner (@sctyner) and Kiegan Rice (@kiegan), both alumni of the Iowa State University statistics department, the oldest in the country. This project is inspired by the discussion surrounding [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/daniela_witten/status/1268392721275744256?s=20) by Daniela Witten, the Dorothy Gilford Endowed Chair of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Washington. Briefly, the thread is grappling with having our prestigious statistics awards be named after RA Fisher, a eugenicist, and what that means about who we celebrate in our profession. 

Sam and Kiegan feel that we know very little about the history of statistics and the history of the statisticians whose work we rely on every day. This document is intended to be a crowd-sourced collection of resources for statisticians to learn about our own history. Please contribute by filing an issue or a pull request. Note that by contributing to this project you agree to adhere to the contributor code of conduct. Please read it carefully.
